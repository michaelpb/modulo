        <h1>Alpha release</h1>
    

    

    

    

    


</mws-devlognav>


<p>After years of development as a side-project, I'm super excited to announce
that Modulo is now ready to be shown as an "alpha" quality framework! The plan
for this alpha release is to get early feedback before we finalize the external
API, or spend time optimizing for DOM performance or the readability of
source-code.</p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>

<p>Are you evaluating different frameworks for a project? I put together this
post so you have a better idea of what to expect, and whether or not Modulo
might be already useful, despite it's early stage of development.</p>

<br>

<section class="Tutorial-tryit" style="margin-top: 10px">
    <h4>Good</h4>

    <p>"Alpha" means "things kinda work".  Here are things I'd recommend using
    Modulo for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Trying it out</em> - Maybe you're shopping for a new lightweight
        framework, or love trying out new ideas in terms of framework structure.
        Modulo takes a different approach, and hopefully puts a bit of "fun" into
        component development, with it's demo library!</li>

        <li><em>Building components libraries for server-side web apps</em> -
        Despite the bugs and potential API changes, the Modulo JS framework is
        completely usable for building JavaScript components to fill in gaps in
        your existing web apps. Once you develop a functional component library,
        you can export the JS and CSS file, and include it into other projects,
        without any of the other Modulo boilerplate. This allows for easing into
        frontend development on backend-focused apps.</li>

        <li><em>Greenfielding simple SSG sites</em> - Although the CLI-based SSG
        isn't fully documented, it's still usable, and easy to get going. In fact,
        <code>npm init modulo</code> is all it takes to begin! After all, the
        website you are using right now was built like this.</li>
    </ul>
</section>



<section class="Tutorial-tryit" style="margin-top: 10px">
    <h4>Bad</h4>

    <p>Alpha may mean "things kinda work", but it also means "things kinda don't
    work". Here are known bugs &amp; API changes as of September 2022:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>BUGS!</em> - I bet you'll find a bug or two!</li>

        <li><em>Undocumented CPart API</em> - Most of the custom Component Part
        extension API is undocumented, and some of it is subject to change.
        This means that a big feature of Modulo (developing custom Component
        Parts) is still a bit in flux. However, as of this first alpha, it's
        unlikely to change <em>too</em> much from the API demonstrated in the
        <a href="/demos/#experiments">"Experiments" examples in the Demo
        page</a>, in case you wanted to jump the gun.</li>

        <li><em>Undocumented engine API</em> - Similarly, extending or
        substituting various "engine" classes in Modulo is undocumented (e.g.
        Reconcile, DOMCursor, AssetManager). The eventual goal is full
        customization of these as well, so that you can incorporate
        image-packing or transformations during the build-step, for example, or
        a more clever DOM resolver that better guesses element changes. The
        Templater has an example in the Experiments page.</li>

        <li><em>Undocumented CLI</em> - The CLI is mostly complete, but may
        undergo UI changes, and is mostly undocumented.</li>

        <li><em>Browser compatibility</em> - While it's tested on recent-ish
        versions of the most popular browsers (e.g. Chrom(ium), Firefox, etc),
        there is no automated browser compatibility testing or browser "matrix"
        or anything. The eventual goal is something like the (now legacy)
        Polymer system of shims: Clearly show which browsers are it's core
        target for compatibility (e.g. shim-free), which ones require shims,
        and which ones will not be targeted at all.</li>

        <li><em>Nested components</em> - There are some bugs and unexpected
        behavior around nested components and dataProps referencing the context
        of parent components in "slotted" DOM elements.</li>

        <li><em>Unstable builds</em> - Builds are unpredictable and
        inconsistent.  The same boilerplate sometimes generates different
        hashes.</li>

        <li><em>Poorly documented Library, namespace, and loading logic</em> -
        The <code>&lt;Library&gt;</code> CPart tag is intended to make it easier
        to keep your library files encapsulated and redistributable. Currently,
        the behavior is non-ideal and will likely be changed, especially around
        distinguishing "configuration" from "definition", "namespace" from the
        unique "definition names" that CParts get, and so on. The documentation
        will need updates on this as well.</li>

        <li><em>Undocumented and config logic and changing API</em> - Modulo
        has an undocumented configuration system, intended to be leveraged both
        internally and by CPart developers for a consistent way to configure
        third party middleware as it gets integrated. The API for this is
        likely to change, and thus is mostly undocumented.</li>

        <li><em>Poor code quality</em> - Not only has the code base (slightly!)
        exceeded 2000 lines of code, which is pushing the envelope in terms of
        complexity and framework "heaviness", but it is also filled with
        commented out code, repeated code, hacked-together messes just to get
        tests running, and so on. As of writing this post, there are 93
        instances of <code>TODO</code> and 19 instances of <code>XXX</code> in
        the Modulo.js file, so clearly some work to be done there!</li>
    </ul>
