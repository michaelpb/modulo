<h3>The specter of the 90s is haunting web-dev...</h3>

<p>I've been noticing more and more developers online, especially the 90s web
old-heads out there, reminiscing over the simpler times of Web 1.0. This trend
is seen in a wide range, from minimalist bare-HTML to the GIF-laden
retro-aesthetic, with both extremes related to an increasingly dominant design
trend, somewhat ostentatiously described as <em>Web Neau Brutalism</em>. This
trend isn't just aesthetic, however. It is also a reaction to how Internet
users increasingly use centralized platforms (social media, mobile apps, etc).
Web 1.0 is thus representing an “<em>actually</em> decentralized and
user-controlled space for storing knowledge and communication”.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I admit, as a web developer who started in the 90s, I'm
squarely in the right demographic, and not surprisingly I generally agree with
the aims of this "trend", if it could be said to have aims.  However, I
wouldn't even really say that Modulo is part of the "Web 1.0 trend", as it's
built on top of the extremely complex execution environments that the modern
web standards for web-browsers specify. That makes it quite the opposite of the
simple elegance of, for example, the Gopher protocol, the failed alternative
that could have saved us from the mess of HTTP (or so say its advocates)
<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. That said, there's a clear similarity, as I
took a pretty different approach for Modulo than most other JS frameworks:
HTML-first.</p>

<p>I hope that Modulo might be a bit of a compromise: A JS framework that the
ascetic "90s-web" nerds tolerate, while still forming a bridge with the
new-shiny hype-train devs.</p>

<p>I wrote this article to go over my recollection of some of the history of
the web, moments that I think might be valuable to consider, and how that
influences decisions with Modulo, which is getting closer and closer to an more
stable release — only a few API and bug "show-stoppers" left.</p>

    <li>1: When I say "actually decentralized", I mean as opposed to those
    Ponzi scams these days that dishonestly use words like "decentralized" to
    imitate Computer Science jargon and sucker people in.</li>

    <a name="fn2"></a>
    <li>2: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher
    Protocol</a> is a menu-based, intentionally limited protocol. It is seeing a bit
    bit of a renaissance among web developers who subscribe to the current
    (or so say its advocates - I pessimistically think that HTTP's bloat would
    have just happened to Gopher, since the bad stuff happened due to corporate
    + money reasons, but that's a different story)
