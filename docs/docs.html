        <aside>

            <p><strong>Q: Why call it Modulo?</strong></p>
            <p>A: From Wikipeda: “In mathematics, the term modulo is often
            used to assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be
            regarded as equivalent if their difference is accounted for by an
            additional factor.” Basically, it's math jargon to say two
            things are equivalent in a given condition or context.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, maybe the goal of Modulo is provide that context, making a
            natural way to integrate the new and the old! Or maybe it sounded
            cool. Maybe that!</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't <em>Modulo</em> already a thing in
            JavaScript?</strong></p>
            <p>Ironically, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder">JavaScript does not have a modulo operator</a>!
            Instead, it uses the percent sign as a <em>remainder operator</em>,
            which behaves similarly for some numbers, but differs for negative
            numbers. So, while Modulo.js is not the first thing to be called
            <abbr title="At the time of picking the name, there were a couple
            similarly named projects, though none seem to be in active use or
            development for years.">"Modulo" in JS</abbr> it <em>is not</em>
            named after the <code>%</code> operator in JavaScript, making both
            the logo and name are a bit of a tongue-in-cheek jab at our
            favorite (but often deficient) computer language.</p>
            <!--You can think of it as the missing modulo! (Except not at all.)-->

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Why yet another JavaScript framework?</strong></p>
            <p>A: To me, the very idea of writing YET ANOTHER JavaScript framework
            is vomit inducing.<br>And yet here I am.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While working at Kickstart Coding, developing our Django-based
            LMS, nothing quite fit the bill for a very simple JS framework to
            sprinkle in some extra interactive features to an otherwise very
            straight-forward multi-page web app. The current solution was a
            mess of Vue and scattered vanilla JavaScript (okay, and a few old
            jQuery plugins, that we'll totally get rid of ASAP totally), with
            the build-step and mounting code for the Vue code getting almost as
            complicated as the little it was even doing.</p> <br>
            <p>We didn't have the developer bandwidth needed for a SPA, and the
            poor state of JS code was slowing down building features, not to
            mention the brittle mounting process was hard to test.  If only I
            could just <em>go in there and do some JS</em> without any more
            fuss... but also develop using hot-reloading and a bundle in the
            end. So, I gave up, gave in, and became the problem. I wrote yet
            another JavaScript component framework.</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't custom DOM-resolution good / bad?</strong></p>
            <p>Maybe. But the good news is, with Modulo you get both!</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Any future plans?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes, plenty! The three main ones: SSG, server-side, and MDU.
            Currently, this site is already getting generated with a
            Modulo-based SSG. However, it's undocumented and messy, so it still
            needs work before it's released externally. On a similar note,
            there are plans for a JAMstack-style SSG + server-side combo, with
            live-refresh inspired by Phoenix LiveView. Finally, developing this
            site requires developing some key components, so I also hope to
            have time to document and release "mdu", which will be a standard
            library of Modulo components, including a Router system inspired by
            React Router.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Q: Why do you care so much about short source code
            files? Don't you want a framework that does more?</strong></p>
            <p>A: In my opinion, the most important feature about a framework
            like this is documentation and structure, not functionality.
            Specifically, my coding philosophy is that good frameworks should
            have aim first and foremost to have a high "documentation to code"
            ratio. This is because a framework is much more than simply a set
            of libraries to import. Choosing a framework represents buy-in to
            file and directory structures, recipes, best practices, code
            patterns, and so on. I don't want to have to dig through
            <em>other</em> people's code to figure out how to solve <em>my</em>
            problems. Instead, a good framework should come "batteries
            included" with documentation that clearly indicates how to solve
            common problems.</p>

            <p>Thus, to pump up our "doc/code" ratio, the easiest thing is to
            keep the denominator as low as possible.  This is especially true
            for a new, solo-developed framework project such as this one.
            Similarly, I think that frameworks should seek to be as simple
            and elegant as possible, especially in this case, when the
            framework is a layer on top of existing web standards (the web
            component standard). In this case, adding anything more would
            constitute over-engineering.</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: 80 char line limit? 4 space indentation? Imperative
            coding? What is this, the 90's?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Another motivating factor for developing Modulo was dismay at
            the code quality of many JavaScript libraries that I use. This is
            not a slight on any particular library, nor is it a claim that I
            write better code—in fact, outside of Modulo.js itself, all
            the tooling code in this repo is a mess! However, for Modulo.js
            itself, I invested most of the development time in refactoring it
            over and over, until the code and logical flow was as simple as
            possible. My goal is to make the code readable and be a good
            example for novice coders.  I want engineers of all skill levels to
            be able to understand <em>why</em> the framework behaves the way it
            does by simply reading the code that powers certain features.</p>

            <p>That's where the coding standard comes in. Shorter line length and
            "more intense" indentation requirements naturally causes simpler,
            less convoluted code, causing desirable side-effects such as lower
            cyclomatic complexity in functions. It might not be "pleasant" to
            write under these conditions, but code is written once and read
            1000 times. Modulo code was written to be easily read, not easily
            written.</p>
