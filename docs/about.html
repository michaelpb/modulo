        <aside>

            <p><strong>Q: Why call it Modulo?</strong></p>
            <p>A: From Wikipeda: “In mathematics, the term modulo is often
            used to assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be
            regarded as equivalent if their difference is accounted for by an
            additional factor.” Basically, it's math jargon to say two
            things are equivalent in a given condition or context.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, maybe the goal of Modulo is provide that context, making a
            natural way to integrate the new and the old! Or maybe it sounded
            cool. Maybe that!</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't <em>Modulo</em> already a thing in
            JavaScript?</strong></p>
            <p>Ironically, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder">JavaScript does not have a modulo operator</a>!
            Instead, it uses the percent sign as a <em>remainder operator</em>,
            which behaves similarly for some numbers, but differs for negative
            numbers. So, while Modulo.js is not the first thing to be called
            <abbr title="At the time of picking the name, there were a couple
            similarly named projects, though none seem to be in active use or
            development for years.">"Modulo" in JS</abbr> it <em>is not</em>
            named after the <code>%</code> operator in JavaScript, making both
            the logo and name are a bit of a tongue-in-cheek jab at our
            favorite (but often deficient) computer language.</p>
            <!--You can think of it as the missing modulo! (Except not at all.)-->

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Why yet another JavaScript framework?</strong></p>
            <p>A: To me, the very idea of writing YET ANOTHER JavaScript framework
            is vomit inducing.<br>And yet here I am.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While working at Kickstart Coding, developing our Django-based
            LMS, nothing quite fit the bill for a very simple JS framework to
            sprinkle in some extra interactive features to an otherwise very
            straight-forward multi-page web app. The current solution was a
            mess of Vue and scattered vanilla JavaScript (okay, and a few old
            jQuery plugins, that we'll totally get rid of ASAP totally), with
            the build-step and mounting code for the Vue code getting almost as
            complicated as the little it was even doing.</p> <br>
            <p>We didn't have the developer bandwidth needed for a SPA, and the
            poor state of JS code was slowing down building features, not to
            mention the brittle mounting process was hard to test.  If only I
            could just <em>go in there and do some JS</em> without any more
            fuss... but also develop using hot-reloading and a bundle in the
            end. So, I gave up, gave in, and became the problem. I wrote yet
            another JavaScript component framework.</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't custom DOM-resolution good / bad?</strong></p>
            <p>Maybe. But the good news is, with Modulo you get both!</p>
