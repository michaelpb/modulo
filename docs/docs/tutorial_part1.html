<h1>The Modulo Tutorial: Part 1</h1>

<blockquote> <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Part 1 and Part 2 of this
tutorial requires a prerequisite knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS only.  Part 3
requires familiarity with JavaScript. Familiarity with React, Vue, or similar
frameworks is helpful, but not required.</p></blockquote>

<p>Welcome to the Modulo tutorial. By following this short tutorial, you can
learn how to use Modulo in your own projects.</p>

<h3>When to use Modulo</h3>

<p>Modulo is useful when using plain HTML and CSS is no longer sufficient. It
has no dependencies, has no "build process", and does not require experience
with JavaScript, terminal applications, or NPM. This means it can
be equally easily incorporated into a plain HTML "static site" (e.g. when you
assemble HTML, CSS, and other static assets in a directory), or into a
"multi-page" web app built with a backend language or MVC framework.</p>


<p><strong>Ready to dive into Web Component development with
Modulo?</strong></p>



<mws-section name="components" modulo-prerendered="1. Components">
        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="components" name="components" href="#components">#</a>
        <h2>1. Components</h2>
    </mws-section>

<h3>Including Modulo</h3>

<p>The first step is to include the Modulo.js file. You can do this one of
3 ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using a script tag to directly link to a CDN hosting the Modulo.js file
    <em>(easiest, you'll do this in the first exercise)</em></li>
    <li>Manually downloading the Modulo.js file and including it with a script
    tag, e.g.  <code>&lt;script src="/js/Modulo.js"&gt;</code> <em>(good for
    working offline, or for bundling Modulo with other JS frameworks)</em></li>
    <li>Including a "self-bundled" Modulo "build" that packs your custom
    components into a single JS file for faster load times <em>(more advanced
    usage, covered at the end of Part 2 of this tutorial)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Once Modulo.js is included in a page, Modulo itself needs to be explicitly
activated. Until Modulo is activated, it <em>WILL NOT</em> register any
components or do anything at all.  Activate Modulo with the following code
placed somewhere before the closing "body" tag of your HTML file:</p>
<pre>&lt;script&gt;Modulo.defineAll()&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can have it only activate after the page finishes
loading. This allows you to place the <code>script</code> tag anywhere on the
page:</p>
<pre>&lt;script&gt;window.onload = () =&gt; Modulo.defineAll()&lt;/script&gt;</pre>


<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Why use "components"?</strong> Have you ever repeated the same
    HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript while writing a website or or web app?
    <em>Components</em> let you store repeated code in one place. Once defined,
    components can be re-used everywhere, saving developer time and reducing
    mistakes. Furthermore, within teams, components libraries improve
    collaboration between developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Defining your first component</h3>

<p>Once you have included Modulo and activated it, you can define your first
<em>custom component</em>. Right now, we'll do that "embedded" into one file
for simplicity's sake, although before the end of this section, we'll learn how
to split your components into a separate file, which is the preferred way.</p>


<p><strong>Component definitions</strong> start with a "component"
opening tag in the format of
<code>&lt;component&nbsp;name="HelloWorld"&gt;</code>. Modulo will look for
these tags, defining components for each one it encounters.  Every component
definition must specify a name, conventionally in <code>UpperCamelCase</code>.
This is just a convention when writing code: Technically HTML tag names are all
case insensitive, and so while inspecting the DOM, browsers typically display
them in <code>all-lowercase</code>, removing any capitalization.</p>

<p>Once defined, you can use a component by referring to it's name as though it
were a plain HTML tag. Components can go anywhere that plain HTML tags can go,
and can be styled with CSS the same way as well.  In other words, creating a
component is like creating a brand-new type of HTML tag that can be used
anywhere, just like the original HTML tags of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, etc.</p>

<p>
Unlike plain HTML tags, you must use a dash
(<code>-</code>) when referring to a component.  This is a rule of the HTML5
Custom Components standard, which Modulo is based upon.
Modulo's default behavior is to prefix custom components with an
<code>x-</code>. So, if a component is defined like
<code>&lt;component&nbsp;name="HelloWorld"&gt;</code>, then it can be
referenced elsewhere like
<code>&lt;x-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/x-HelloWorld&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, one more thing: When defining custom components in an HTML
document, you can't put them scattered everywhere. You have to keep them in one
place. Specifically, to keep things neater, Modulo searches for component
definitions only within a <code>modulo-embed</code> tag:
<code>&lt;template modulo-embed&gt;</code></p>

<p>To quickly summarize: Components are reusable bits of HTML, JS, and CSS
code, and must be defined within a tag like
<code>&lt;component&nbsp;name="HelloWorld"&gt;</code>, and then this definition
can be embedded in an HTML page within a tag like
<code>&lt;template&nbsp;modulo-embed&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, enough talk, let's actually try this out!</strong></p>

<mws-section name="cparts" modulo-prerendered="2. CParts">

        <h2>2. CParts</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>The central concept to Modulo is that of <em>Component Parts</em>.
Because it is so central, saying <em>Component Parts</em> over and over
gets tiresome, so it's typically shortened to <em>CParts</em>.</p>

<blockquote> <p><strong>CParts: The Musical</strong> Think of CParts like the
cast and crew of a musical. Each are assigned to a different task—some
are more flashy and visible, others being stage-hands working behind the
scenes—but they all work together to put on the same
show!</p></blockquote>

<p>All component definitions consist of some number of CParts.  Thus, a
component definition is really just a collection of CPart definitions.
"Under the hood" of your component, each CPart will have a different role
to contribute to the functionality of your component.</p>

<!--<p> When a component definition is later instantiated (i.e., when that
component is used on the page), Modulo will in turn instantiate (i.e.
create an instance of) a CPart for each of the CPart definitions contained
in the component definition.</p>-->

<p>Let's start with the two most basic CParts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Template</strong> - <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>
        <p>Templates are where you put any arbitrary HTML code that you
        want your component to contain. For now, we'll just include some
        unchanging HTML. Later, we'll learn how to use "templating
        language" to control what HTML is produced in what
        circumstance.</p>
    </li>

    <li>

        <blockquote> <p><strong>Where to put CSS</strong> Instead of a
        Style CPart, you can always link a global CSS file the regular way
        to style your components.  However, many developers prefer the
        simplicity of keeping everything in one place, e.g. the CSS with
        the component definition that it styles.</p></blockquote>

        <strong>Style</strong> - <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
        <p>Just like the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in HTML, the
        <strong>Style</strong> CPart allows us to write CSS for our
        component. CSS written here will be automatically prefixed so that
        it will only apply to your component and any HTML generated by the
        Template CPart.
        </p>

    </li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout Modulo documentation, there are little code editors, like below.
These allow you to immediately practice new concepts learned. For simplicity,
the top and bottom of the component definition code is omitted.  Instead, these
sample code editors only focus on the CPart definitions within.</p>

        (<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>) to add or modify CSS</li>
        <li>Practice incorporating these CParts into your own components on
        a real page by copying the code here and pasting it within your
        component definition (that is, the one that you created in the

        <h2>3. Loading Libraries</h2>
    </mws-section>

<blockquote> <p><strong>Why use load?</strong>
Think of the <code>&lt;load&gt;</code> tag as being analogous to the
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, which lets multiple HTML files share the
same CSS. The same rationale applies here: Components are "write once, use
everywhere", so the way we get access to them "everywhere" is by
<em>loading</em> them into each file that needs to use them. Other
reasons include that <code>&lt;load&gt;</code> smooths over certain browser
limitations, and that it can keep your files neater.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Up until now, we have practiced with a component embedded on the same page
that it is used. This is not recommended. Instead, you should put your
components in a separate <em>component library</em> HTML file, and then use the
<code>&lt;load&gt;</code> tag to import your components into every HTML file
that needs them.</p>


<p>"Load" tags look like the following:</p>

<pre>&lt;load
    src="./components/my-stuff.html"
    namespace="coolstuff"&gt;
&lt;/load&gt;
</pre>

<p>Let's break this down:</p>
<ul>

    <li>
        <code>src="./components/my-stuff.html"</code>
        <p>The <code>src</code> attribute specifies the source of the
        component library file. This file can be anywhere that is
        accessible to your web-browser or web-server. Ideally, it should be
        in the same place as your CSS and static media files, such as a
        <code>static/</code> directory, or whatever the equivalent is for
        your set-up.</p>
        <p>The component library itself (<code>my-stuff.html</code> in this
        example) should consist of an HTML file filled with
        <code>&lt;component&gt;</code> definitions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>

        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Why use namespaces?</strong>
        Namespaces allow different component library files to have
        conflicting component names. This is especially useful when using
        third-party component libraries or while working in a big team:
        That way, if both you and another developer define a component with
        some common name (eg <code>name="Button"</code>), there won't be a
        conflict as long as you load each into different namespaces.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <code>namespace="coolstuff"</code>
        <p>The <code>namespace</code> attribute specifies the
        <em>namespace prefix</em>, which is combined with a dash and the
        component name in order to create the component's <em>full
        name</em>. </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If <code>my-stuff.html</code> has a component
        defined like <code>&lt;component name="MyThing"&gt;</code>
        imported with <code>namespace="coolstuff"</code>, then the
        resulting full name would be <code>coolstuff-MyThing</code>, and
        we'd use the component like<br>
        <code>&lt;coolstuff-MyThing&gt;&lt;/coolstuff-MyThing&gt;</code>.</p>
    </li>


    <li><strong>Where to put it:</strong> Loaders can go anywhere. For
    neatness, consider putting them either within the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, or near the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
    closing tag.</li>
</ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Optional: Create a new "components" directory to house your
        component library files.</li>
        <li>Create a new file for your component library within your
        components directory (or elsewhere). You could call it, for
        example, <code>my-component-lib.html</code></li>
        <li>Copy your existing <code>HelloWorld</code> component definition
        from your main HTML file into this new file, and then delete it
        from your main HTML file. If done correctly, your new component library
        file (e.g. <code>my-component-lib.html</code>) should contain the
        following text (note the lack of "modulo-embed"):

            <em>Note: This is meant for exploring features. Your work will not be saved.</em>

            <button class="m-Btn m-Btn--sm m-Btn--faded" title="Copy this code" @click:="script.doCopy">
                Copy <span alt="Clipboard">📋</span>
            </button>
        

        

    </div>

    <div class="side-by-side-panes">
        <div class="editor-wrapper">

        </div>

</mws-demo></li>

        <li>Add a <code>load</code> tag to your main HTML file. It
        should have the <code>src=</code> attribute pointing toward a
        relative path to your new component library file, and namespace can
        be <code>lib</code>.  For example, if you named everything based on
        the above suggestions, it would look like this:
<mws-demo text="
<template modulo-embed>
    <load
        src=&quot;./components/my-component-lib.html&quot;
        namespace=&quot;lib&quot;
    ></load>
</template>
" modulo-prerendered=""><div class="demo-wrapper
        
           demo-wrapper__clipboard  
        
        demo-wrapper__notabs     
    ">
    

    <div class="editor-toolbar">
        <p style="font-size: 11px; width: 120px; margin-right: 10px; text-align: right;
                     display: none; ">
            <em>Note: This is meant for exploring features. Your work will not be saved.</em>
        </p>

        
            <button class="m-Btn m-Btn--sm m-Btn--faded" title="Copy this code" @click:="script.doCopy">
                Copy <span alt="Clipboard">📋</span>
            </button>
        

        

    </div>

    <div class="side-by-side-panes">
        <div class="editor-wrapper">
            <div modulo-ignore="">
            </div>
        </div>

        

    </div>
</div>

</mws-demo></li>



        <li>Finally, update your main HTML file's usage of the component to now
        use the new namespace (instead of the "x" default namespace
        placeholder):
<pre>&lt;lib-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/lib-HelloWorld&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a P tag: &lt;lib-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/lib-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></li>
        <li>Refresh the web browser to view the results. If done correctly,
        nothing should change. To confirm it's working, try editing your
        component in the library file and refresh to see the results.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Bonus Challenge:</strong>
    Try practicing with multiple "main HTML" files sharing the same
    component library. Also, if you used the example name, consider renaming
    your component library. Consider naming it something that is relevant to
    you, e..g "ecommerce-website-components" or something, whatever you think
    is a good name based on what you are working on. Finally, practice changing
    the namespace, or see if you can cause (and fix using the namespace
    attribute) a naming conflict with two components.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Summary</h3>

<p>In this tutorial, we learned what a <em>Component</em> is, and how to
define one, about what <em>CParts</em> are, and two important CParts
(<em>Template</em>, for HTML, and <em>Style</em>, for CSS), and finally how
to keep our components in a component library and then load that library
into different HTML files. At this point, you can already start getting
useful results from using Modulo, since even without JavaScript usage we
are already defining simple components that can help us re-use HTML code
between different pages.</p>


<h4>Key terms</h4>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Component</strong> - A discrete, re-usable bit of code, typically
used to show a graphical UI element (eg a button, or a rich-text area).
Components can also use other components (eg a form component might contain
both of the above as child components).  </li>

<li>ComponentPart, or <strong>CPart</strong> - Each component consists of a
"bag" or "bundle" of CParts, each CPart being a "pluggable" module that
supplies different functionality for that component.  Every component is
defined as a collection of CParts (e.g.  HTML <em>Template</em>, or
<em>Style</em> tag).</li>

<li><strong>customElement</strong> - The term used for a custom HTML5 web
component, which is the underlying technology that Modulo is a thin wrapper
over. They all have dashes (<code>-</code>) in the name.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the subsequent tutorials we will go deeper: Explore the full
capabilities of Templates, allow flexible and composable components with
Props CPart, create custom behavior with Script CParts,  and finally create
forms and interactive, changing components with the State CPart.</p>
