            <p><strong>Q: Why call it Modulo?</strong></p>
            <p>A: From Wikipeda: &ldquo;In mathematics, the term modulo is often
            used to assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be
            regarded as equivalent if their difference is accounted for by an
            additional factor.&rdquo; Basically, it's math jargon to say two
            things are equivalent in a given condition or context.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So, maybe the goal of Modulo is provide that context, making a
            natural way to integrate the new and the old! Or maybe it sounded
            cool. Maybe that!</p>

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't <em>Modulo</em> already a thing in
            JavaScript?</strong></p>
            <p>Ironically, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder">JavaScript does not have a modulo operator</a>!
            Instead, it uses the percent sign as a <em>remainder operator</em>,
            which behaves similarly for some numbers, but differs for negative
            numbers. So, while Modulo.js is not the first thing to be called
            <abbr title="At the time of picking the name, there were a couple
            similarly named projects, though none seem to be in active use or
            development for years.">"Modulo" in JS</abbr> it <em>is not</em>
            named after the <code>%</code> operator in JavaScript, making both
            the logo and name are a bit of a tongue-in-cheek jab at our
            favorite (but often deficient) computer language.</p>
            <!--You can think of it as the missing modulo! (Except not at all.)-->

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Why yet another JavaScript framework?</strong></p>
            <p>A: To me, the very idea of writing YET ANOTHER JavaScript framework
            is vomit inducing.<br />And yet here I am.</p>
            <br />
            <p>While working at Kickstart Coding, developing our Django-based
            LMS, nothing quite fit the bill for a very simple JS framework to
            sprinkle in some extra interactive features to an otherwise very
            straight-forward multi-page web app. The current solution was a
            mess of Vue and scattered vanilla JavaScript (okay, and a few old
            jQuery plugins, that we'll totally get rid of ASAP totally), with
            the build-step and mounting code for the Vue code getting almost as
            complicated as the little it was even doing.</p> <br />
            <p>We didn't have the developer bandwidth needed for a SPA, and the
            poor state of JS code was slowing down building features, not to
            mention the brittle mounting process was hard to test.  If only I
            could just <em>go in there and do some JS</em> without any more
            fuss... but also develop using hot-reloading and a bundle in the
            end. So, I gave up, gave in, and became the problem. I wrote yet
            another JavaScript component framework.</p>

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't custom DOM-resolution good / bad?</strong></p>
            <p>Maybe. But the good news is, with Modulo you get both!</p>
