<h1>CParts</h1>

<p>The central concept to Modulo is that of <em>Component Parts</em>. Because
it is so central, saying <em>Component Parts</em> over and over gets tiresome,
so it's typically shortened to <em>CParts</em>.</p>

<p>Every component definition consists of configuring one or more CPart
definitions. In fact, the <em>Component</em> CPart



<mdu-Section name="spares">CPart Spares</mdu-Section>

<p>If you have extra car parts lying around, you call them <em>spare
parts</em>, or just "spares". In Modulo, extra or inactive CParts are also
called Spares.</p>

<p>The use for this might be to have more than one <em>Template</em> that can
be switched out depending on what data model is being used, more than one
<em>State</em> to allow for both private and shared data between components, or
more than one <em>Script</em> to be swapped to quickly change behavior based on
if the user is logged in or out. Many of these things might be doable without
CPart spares, such as with if-statements, but spares provide a paradigm for
working comfortably with multiple CParts.</p>


<p>When you have duplicate CParts of the same type in a component, one CPart
a time of each type is the "active" CPart, accessible in the
<code>element.cparts</code> object. The others are "spares", and accessible in
<code>element.cpartSpares</code>.</p>
