            <p><strong>Zero set-up</strong> - Like the golden age of jQuery,
            just drop it into any HTML file.  Unlike jQuery, that 1 file packs
            in a component system, hot-reloading, a tiny build system to pack
            your CSS and JS for production, and even debug tools.</p>

            <p><strong>Very vanilla</strong> -  Modulo doesn't re-invent any
            wheels. Like Polymer (LitElement) or Skate.js, Modulo is built as a
            thin-layer over web standards that are now well-supported. In fact,
            if used purely for stateless components, it's all HTML and CSS!</p>

            <p><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> - JAMStack is fine and
            all, but what about all our existing server-side apps in Ruby on
            Rails, Python and Django, or that one home-grown PHP monster that
            will never go away? Modulo was made to give structure and
            convenience to that extra sprinkle of JavaScript that will make
            your "traditional" web apps <em>shine</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>CParts</strong> - Create components by putting together
            one or more Component Parts or <em>CParts</em>. Mix Script, Style,
            State, Props, and Templates to make components that have one or
            all, or multiples, of these features. Combine CParts between
            components for a powerful system of "composition-based" inheritance
            that's more familiar to web developers.</p>
            <p><strong>Everything is swappable</strong> - Components configure
            themselves, meaning you can "mix and match" templating languages,
            or try out DOM-resolution on or off per-component basis.</p>
            <p><strong>Lifecycle hooks and directives</strong> - Hook your
            own code into the component rendering lifecycle, either through
            callbacks, or by defining custom attribute-based directives.</p>

            <p><strong>"It's like React"</strong> - Modulo has components,
            props, state, lifecycle methods, virtual DOM (if you want it),
            hot-reloading, debugging tools with introspection - get the
            creature comforts of React or Vue, but with a compatible syntax and
            a shorter time to integrate.</p>
            <p><strong>Concise</strong> - The code-base is intentionally kept
            short &amp; sweet, so when something goes wrong you can always
            <tt>git blame</tt> Modulo.</p>
            <p><strong>Opinionated defaults</strong> - Modulo is cohesive,
            coming with a templating system and DOM resolution out-of-the-box.
            Modulo is for people who like the consistency of following the
            rules, but we're all adults now so it's okay to break 'em if they
            get in the way, meaning any of these defaults can be replaced.  But
            like your parents always warned you, "Don't directly mutate state!"
            </p>
            <!--<p><strong>No more of "this"</strong> - OOP in JavaScript? Not a
            fan.</p>
            <p><strong>Fork it</strong> - It's small so you can make it your
            own.</p>-->
