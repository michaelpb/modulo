    <h2>Modulo Tutorial, Part 1:<br />
        Your first component</h2>


    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
    Part 1 of this tutorial requires a prerequisite knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS
    only.  Parts 2 and onward require familiarity with JavaScript.</p>

    <p><strong>Other frameworks</strong> Modulo shares a common set of
    terminology with frameworks like React and Vue, and a similar syntax and
    component definition structure to Vue, Svelt, or Riot.js. Similar to
    Polymer (now litElement), it is based on the Web Components API that is
    standard in all modern browsers.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Including Modulo</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Modulo tutorial. By following these short tutorials, you
    can learn how to use Modulo in your own projects.</p>

    <p>The first step is to include the Modulo.js file. You can do this one of
    2 ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a script tag to directly link to the minified version on a
        CDN <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>
        <li>Downloading the Modulo.js and including it with a script tag, e.g.
        <code>&lt;script src="/js/Modulo.js"&gt;</code>
    </ol>

    <p>Then, Modulo needs to be explicitly activated. Somewhere before the closing body tag of your HTML file, you should activate Modulo with the following code:
        <code>&lt;script&gt;Modulo.defineAll();&lt;script&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Defining your first component</h3>

    <p>Once you have included Modulo and activated it, you can define your
    first <em>custom component</em>. Right now, we'll do that all in one file,
    although soon we'll learn how to split your components into a separate
    file, which is the preferred way.</p>


    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Why use "components"?</strong> Have you ever repeated the
        same HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript while writing a website or or web
        app? <em>Components</em> let you store repeated code in one place. Once
        defined, components can be re-used everywhere, saving developer time
        and reducing mistakes. Furthermore, within teams, components libraries
        improve collaboration between developers.</p>
    </blockquote>


    <p><strong>Component definitions</strong> start with a "component"
    opening tag in the format of
    <code>&lt;component&nbsp;name="HelloWorld"&gt;</code>. Modulo will scan a
    document for these tags, creating components for each one it encounters.
    Every component definition must specify a name, conventionally in
    <code>UpperCamelCase</code> (although technically component names are case
    insensitive).</p>

    <p>Once defined, you can use a component by referring to it's name as
    though it were a plain HTML tag like &lt;div&gt;. Components can go
    anywhere that plain HTML tags can go, and can be styled with CSS the same
    way as well. Unlike plain HTML tags, you must use a dash (<code>-</code>)
    when referring to a component, such as by prefixing with an "x" as such:
    <code>x-</code>. This is a rule of the HTML5 Custom Components
    standard, which Modulo is based upon.</p>

    <p>So, if a component is defined like
    <code>&lt;component&nbsp;name="HelloWorld"&gt;</code>, then it can be
    referenced elsewhere like
    <code>&lt;x-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/x-HelloWorld&gt;</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Okay, enough talk, let's actually try this out!</strong></p>


    <section class="Tutorial-tryit">
        <h4>Try it now</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open up an HTML file in your preferred text editor. It's okay
            to start from scratch, or use an existing project.</li>
            <li>Open that HTML file in your preferred web browser as well.</li>
            <li>Copy &amp; paste in the following code:
<pre>
&lt;!-- Define a custom component --&gt;
&lt;component name="HelloWorld"&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;
        Hello &lt;strong&gt;Modulo&lt;/strong&gt; World!
    &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;


&lt;!-- Reuse it anywhere, just like any other HTML tag --&gt;
&lt;x-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/x-HelloWorld&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a P tag: &lt;x-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/x-HelloWorld&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;!-- Finally, include Modulo CDN &amp; activate (at the bottom) --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.skypack.dev/modulo?min"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;Modulo.defineAll();&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></li>
            <li>Refresh the web browser to view the results.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>The anatomy of a component definition</h3>

    <p>The central concept to Modulo is that of <em>Component Parts</em>.
    Because it is so central, saying <em>Component Parts</em> over and over got
    old, so it's typically shortened to <em>CParts</em>.</p>

    <blockquote> <p><strong>CParts: The Musical</strong> Think of CParts like the cast and
    crew of a musical. Each are assigned to a different task&mdash;some are
    more flashy and visible, others being stage-hands working behind the
    scenes&mdash;but they all work together to put on the same
    show!</p></blockquote>

    <p>All component definitions consist of some number of CParts.  Thus, a
    component definition can be thought of as merely a collection of CPart
    definitions. When a component definition is later instantiated (i.e., when that
    component is used on the page), it in turn will instantiate (i.e. create an
    instance of) a CPart for each of the CPart definitions contained in the
    component definition. "Under the hood" of your component, each CPart will
    have a different role to contribute to the functionality of your
    component.</p>

    <p>The first two CParts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Template</strong> - <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>
            <p>Templates are where you put any arbitrary HTML code that you
            want your component to contain. For now, we'll just include some
            unchanging HTML. Later, we'll learn how to use "templating
            language" to control what HTML is produced in what
            circumstance.</p>
        </li>

        <li>

            <blockquote> <p><strong>Adding CSS</strong> Instead of a Style
            CPart, you can always link a global CSS file the regular way to
            style your components.  However, many developers prefer the
            simplicity of keeping everything in one place, e.g. the CSS with
            the component definition that it styles.</p></blockquote>

            <strong>Style</strong> - <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
            <p>Just like the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in HTML, the
            <strong>Style</strong> CPart allows us to write CSS for our
            component. CSS written here will be automatically prefixed so that
            it will only apply to your component and any HTML generated by the
            Template CPart.
            </p>

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Throughout Modulo documentation, there are these little embedded code
    editors. These allow you to immediately practice new concepts learned. For
    simplicity, the top and bottom of the component definition code is omitted.
    Instead, these sample code editors only focus on the CPart definitions
    within.</p>

            definition by copying your code here and pasting it within the HTML

            of this tutorial</p>
