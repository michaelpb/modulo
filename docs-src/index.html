            <p><strong>Zero set-up</strong> - Like the golden age of jQuery,
            just drop it into any HTML file.  Unlike jQuery, that 1 file packs
            in a component system, hot-reloading, a tiny build system to pack
            your CSS and JS for production, and even debug tools.</p>

            <p><strong>Very vanilla</strong> -  Modulo doesn't re-invent any
            wheels. Like Polymer (LitElement) or Skate.js, Modulo is built as a
            thin-layer over web standards that are now well-supported. In fact,
            if used purely for stateless components, it's all HTML and CSS!</p>

            <p><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> - JAMStack is fine and
            all, but what about all our existing server-side apps in Ruby on
            Rails, Python and Django, or that one home-grown PHP monster that
            will never go away? Modulo was made to give structure and
            convenience to that extra sprinkle of JavaScript that will make
            your "traditional" web apps <em>shine</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>CParts</strong> - Create components by putting together
            one or more Component Parts or <em>CParts</em>. Mix Script, Style,
            State, Props, and Templates to make components that have one or
            all, or multiples, of these features. Combine CParts between
            components for a powerful system of "composition-based" inheritance
            that's more familiar to web developers.</p>
            <p><strong>Everything is swappable</strong> - Components configure
            themselves, meaning you can "mix and match" templating languages,
            or try out DOM-resolution on or off per-component basis.</p>
            <p><strong>Lifecycle hooks and directives</strong> - Hook your
            own code into the component rendering lifecycle, either through
            callbacks, or by defining custom attribute-based directives.</p>

            <p><strong>"It's like React"</strong> - Modulo has components,
            props, state, lifecycle methods, virtual DOM (if you want it),
            hot-reloading, debugging tools with introspection - get the
            creature comforts of React or Vue, but with a compatible syntax and
            a shorter time to integrate.</p>
            <p><strong>Concise</strong> - The code-base is intentionally kept
            short &amp; sweet, so when something goes wrong you can always
            <tt>git blame</tt> Modulo.</p>
            <p><strong>Opinionated defaults</strong> - Modulo is cohesive,
            coming with a templating system and DOM resolution out-of-the-box.
            Modulo is for people who like the consistency of following the
            rules, but we're all adults now so it's okay to break 'em if they
            get in the way, meaning any of these defaults can be replaced.  But
            like your parents always warned you, "Don't directly mutate state!"

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
        </aside>
        <aside>

            <p><strong>Q: Why call it Modulo?</strong></p>
            <p>A: From Wikipeda: &ldquo;In mathematics, the term modulo is often
            used to assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be
            regarded as equivalent if their difference is accounted for by an
            additional factor.&rdquo; Basically, it's math jargon to say two
            things are equivalent in a given condition or context.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So, maybe the goal of Modulo is provide that context, making a
            natural way to integrate the new and the old! Or maybe it sounded
            cool. Maybe that!</p>

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't <em>Modulo</em> already a thing in
            JavaScript?</strong></p>
            <p>Ironically, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder">JavaScript does not have a modulo operator</a>!
            Instead, it uses the percent sign as a <em>remainder operator</em>,
            which behaves similarly for some numbers, but differs for negative
            numbers. So, while Modulo.js is not the first thing to be called
            <abbr title="At the time of picking the name, there were a couple
            similarly named projects, though none seem to be in active use or
            development for years.">"Modulo" in JS</abbr> it <em>is not</em>
            named after the <code>%</code> operator in JavaScript, making both
            the logo and name are a bit of a tongue-in-cheek jab at our
            favorite (but often deficient) computer language.</p>
            <!--You can think of it as the missing modulo! (Except not at all.)-->

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Why yet another JavaScript framework?</strong></p>
            <p>A: To me, the very idea of writing YET ANOTHER JavaScript framework
            is vomit inducing.<br />And yet here I am.</p>
            <br />
            <p>While working at Kickstart Coding, developing our Django-based
            LMS, nothing quite fit the bill for a very simple JS framework to
            sprinkle in some extra interactive features to an otherwise very
            straight-forward multi-page web app. The current solution was a
            mess of Vue and scattered vanilla JavaScript (okay, and a few old
            jQuery plugins, that we'll totally get rid of ASAP totally), with
            the build-step and mounting code for the Vue code getting almost as
            complicated as the little it was even doing.</p> <br />
            <p>We didn't have the developer bandwidth needed for a SPA, and the
            poor state of JS code was slowing down building features, not to
            mention the brittle mounting process was hard to test.  If only I
            could just <em>go in there and do some JS</em> without any more
            fuss... but also develop using hot-reloading and a bundle in the
            end. So, I gave up, gave in, and became the problem. I wrote yet
            another JavaScript component framework.</p>

            <br />
            <p><strong>Q: Isn't custom DOM-resolution good / bad?</strong></p>
            <p>Maybe. But the good news is, with Modulo you get both!</p>
