<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>This page has a collection of larger demos and library of mini-examples.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike every other page at modulojs.org, this page is
NOT pre-rendered! That means you can use "View Source" (Right click, or Ctrl+U)
to see how Modulo's own website was built.</p>


<section class="Tutorial-tryit">
    <h4>How to "fork" a Modulo.js demo</h4>
    <p>Some of tiles below link to full-page demonstration apps.  These are
    intended as a reference of &ldquo;copy &amp; paste recipes&rdquo; so you
    can get started even quicker with incorporating Modulo into your
    project.</p>
    <p>Every demo can be "forked" (copied) by clicking the "COPY SOURCE" button
    in the top-right. Then, it can be pasted into a local HTML file in your
    text editor. <!--All demos have been designed with absolute URLs, so they
    should &ldquo;just work&rdquo; if pasted in any HTML code, whether that is
    a backend app template (e.g. PHP, Rails, Django), or a static HTML
    file. (Alpha note: Some are relative, need correcting.)--></p>
</section>

<mws-Section name="starter">
    Starter Files
</mws-Section>


<p>These HTML and Zip files are intended to help you start new projects, with
example components already made, to make remembering syntax easier, and Modulo
all configured and ready to go.  Use one of these demo pages to get a
head-start with your own Modulo project.</p>

<!--<h2>Snippets</h2>-->

<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/basic_starter.html">Basic Snippet</a>
        <p>This snippet has a single component defined with examples of common
        CParts and template syntax.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="/demos/components_starter.html">Components Snippet</a>
        <p>This starting snippet defines a small collection of example
        components, demonstrating how to build a site or app.</p>
    </li>

    <!--
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/basic_page.html">Basic Page</a>
        <p>This SPA-style demo includes the page boilerplate (e.g.
        <tt>head</tt>) for a fully valid HTML file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="/demos/bootstrap_page.html">Bootstrap Page</a>
        <p>Similar to the SPA starter page, but with Bootstrap 5 CDN already
        included.</p>

<h2>SPA: Modulo-based layouts</h2>

<p>Thinking Modulo will be taking a "center-stage" in your project, and
handling layout as well? These demos show how you can define Layout elements to
omit HTML boilerplate in your Modulo-powered valid HTML file.</p>

<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/basic_page.html">SPA Page Layout</a>
        <p>A simple start page, with a single component defined to get you
        going.</p>

<mws-Section name="experiments">
    Experiments
</mws-Section>

<p><strong>Experimental:</strong> The following demos show off some of the cool
and unusual things you can get Modulo to do! However, they are designated
"experimental" either because they might be using internal APIs that could
change before the Modulo <em>beta</em>, or require a bit more polish before
they become fully recommended.</p>

<h2>MDU demos</h2>

<p>These demos show off a few MDU CParts, which are still in development.</p>
<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/fetchstate_book_browser.html">FetchState API</a>
        <p>Demonstration of an API-backed, paginated book search app,
        <em>without</em> use of any JavaScript, beyond using the custom CPart
        <em>FetchState</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/jsx_template.html">JSX Templating</a>
        <p>Demonstration of integrating Babel JS and replacing Template CPart
        with custom CPart to enable React-style JSX-syntax in Modulo.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Modulo for Sound & Music</h2>

<p>Modulo's declarative, configuration-focused approach  is especially
well-suited for sound and music related applications. The Tone JS CPart becomes
your own sound engineering "rack" of instruments and effects units, where any
"knob" or configuration setting can be bound to state, and thus to form
controls, just like anything else in Modulo.</p>

<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/tone_example.html">Tone.js Synth</a>
        <p>A fully functional 2-OSC synthesizer, with a simple step sequencer
        and knobs to tweak. Plug-in a USB MIDI keyboard to jam away!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/midi_example.html">USB MIDI Keyboard</a>
        <p>Demonstration of receiving MIDI keyboard input in Modulo, useful for
        sound synthesis, DAW, or apps in music ed.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
