<h1>Lifecycle</h1>



<p>Every Modulo Component goes through a certain "lifecycle". Here's an
analogy: If CParts are the stage-hands and actors who put on a play, then the
"lifecycle" is the pre-described arrangement of each "act", intermission, and
so on, such that every CPart stage-hand "jumps in" at the right moment to do
it's job and set up for the next act.</p>

<mws-Section name="phases">Component lifecycle phases</mws-Section>

<p>Every <em>Component</em> that you define triggers a certain set of lifecycle
phases. The lifecycle phases that a Modulo <em>Component</em> progresses
through can be categorized into a few groups. One way to think of these phases
is that typically, the "output" of a previous lifecycle phase in a group is the
"input" of the next phase. As an example, <code>load</code> generates a flat,
serializable structure that <code>factory</code> uses to instantiate more
complicated JavaScript instances.  Similarly, <code>prepare</code> figures out
the template variables, <code>render</code> causes the template to actually
perform the render based on the variables in the previous phase, and
<code>update</code> updates the HTML of the element based on the rendered
output of the previous phase.</p>


<h3>Group 1: Component Definition</h3>

<p>These phases happen <em>once per component definition</em>. These will
happen even if the component is never used or instantiated anywhere, but only
defined and loaded. They are intended for setting up the component "Factory"
(blueprint for component instances).</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>load</code> - The stage of parsing a code file. This is for
    static analysis and similar pre-processing. Note that if Modulo components
    are cached, or if they are ever pre-compiled into a single JS file, this
    <code>load</code> phase happens BEFORE saving, and thus gets "baked-in".
    This means that the results of a <code>load</code> phase must be
    "serializable", such as in a JSON format.</li>

    <li><code>factory</code> - Any one-time, global set-up for a component
    (e.g. compiling the template). This happens after the <code>load</code>,
    but before the component is used.  Unlike the <code>load</code> phase,
    <code>factory</code> happens after the page loads, and thus does not need
    to generate serializable results.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> "Group 1" is only accessible to <em>CPart</em>
developers, and <em>not</em> accessible to component developers using script
tags.</p>

<h3>Group 2: Component Instantiation</h3>
<p>Currently, only one lifecycle phase is triggered when a component is mounted
on the page.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>initialized</code> - happens once per instance, every time a
    component is instantiated or mounted (i.e. used) on a page. Useful for
    fetching or setting up initial data on a component, as all the component
    will be fully ready for use at this point.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Group 3: Component Rendering</h3>
<p>All of 4 these lifecycle phases trigger in the following sequence every time
a component renders.  This including the first time, every manual rerender
(e.g. invoking <code>element.rerender()</code>), and ever automatic rerender
(e.g. after events or state manipulation). These will phases even trigger if
you don't have a <em>Template</em> CPart defined, although without a
<em>Template</em> there will be nothing to render.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>prepare</code> - Gather data needed before rendering (e.g. gather
    variables for template)</li>
    <li><code>render</code> - Use the Template to render HTML code</li>
    <li><code>reconcile</code> - Compares the new rendered HTML to the DOM, and
    generates a "patch-set" or array of operations necessary to reconcile the
    DOM to the new HTML</li>
    <li><code>update</code> - Applies the "patches" generated in the previous
    step, actually modifying the DOM and invoking directives</li>
</ul>


<h3>Group 4: Directives</h3>

<p>Directives can also have lifecycle phases. More information on them is <a
href="/docs/directives.html">covered in the Directives section</a>. For now,
we'll look at 2 lifecycle phases that are introduced whenever an event occurs.
That is, these phases will be available whenever you attach an event, e.g.
<code>@click</code>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>event</code> - Triggers when an event is about to happen.</li>
    <li><code>eventCleanup</code> - Triggers after an event happened. A common
    pattern is to use this and the previous to figure out what has "changed"
    due to the event, and respond accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<mws-Section name="factory">Mechanics of <em>factory</em> lifecycle</mws-Section>

<p>The "factory" lifecycle behaves slightly differently. Most lifecycle methods
can be invoked by using the <code>lifecycle</code> method of
<code>ModuloElement</code>, e.g.  <code>element.lifecycle('prepare')</code>.
The "factory" lifecycle, however, is run with <code>runFactoryLifecycle</code>,
a method of <code>ComponentFactory</code>, before any components or actual
elements are created.</p>

<p>The is a special lifecycle for any global or one-time setup, after component
definitions are loaded, but before before any components are constructed.
Examples: the Style CPart uses this stage to set up global CSS, the Template
CPart uses this to compile the template and include it in a script tag in the
head, and the Script CPart will actually wrap the script-tag and include into
the head.</p>

<p>Like every other "lifecycle" in Modulo, it passes around a "renderObj"
called baseRenderObj. After this method, this baseRenderObj is not modified,
but instead gets copied into every other renderObj to form, as the name
implies, the "base" of future renderObj.</p>

<p>In total, the <code>runFactoryLifecycle(cPartOpts)</code> method of
<code>ComponentFactory</code> loops through all the CPart names, finding
each relevant CPart Classes, and then invoking each CPart static method
<code>factoryCallback</code>, which is what does the necessary preprocessing.
If there are multiples of the same CPart, then whichever appears last will
overwrite and/or merge data with the previous ones.  However, that particular
behavior can be controlled from within each CPart factoryCallback itself.</p>



<h3>Hooking into a lifecycle phase</h3>

<p>The purpose of <em>lifecycle phases</em> is the <em>lifecycle methods</em>
or functions that "hook into" each phase and run during them.</p>

<p>You can get the name for a <em>lifecycle method</em> by simply suffixing the
name of the phase with the word <code>Callback</code>. For example,
<code>prepare</code> thus becomes <code>function prepareCallback() {...</code>.
Every CPart has the ability to hook into lifecycle methods by defining a method
with an expected name. This is useful for CPart developers to implement the
actual behavior and functionality of a CPart. In fact, most of CPart code is
just hooking into these different methods!</p>

<p>The <em>Script</em> CPart also exposes this interface to component
developers. This is so that you can write custom code in each component to
execute during any one of the phases. Note that you cannot hook into Group 1
phases this way, since those need to happen before your script tag is even
ready (in fact, it's the <code>factoryCallback</code> of <em>Script</em> that
hooks your custom methods into the component lifecycle).</p>

<p>Directives also have callback functions, <a href="#directives">covered
in a later section</a>.</p>

<mws-Section name="renderobj">renderObj</mws-Section>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>renderObj is like "req" </strong> -
<code>renderObj</code> is comparable to the "request" or "response" objects
in many backend MVC frameworks, such as in Express.js or Django. In these,
middleware works behind the scenes to modify or construct the "request" object.
They prepare it for the controller functions that accept it as an argument, by
attaching data and injecting dependencies.  For a concrete example, enabling
Express's JSON parsing middleware adds the <code>req.json</code> attribute to
request objects, for parsing of JSON data.</p>
<p>This is what inspired the
<code>renderObj</code>: It's a plain object that gets passed along throughout
<em>all</em> of the lifecycle phases (including the factory callback!). All the
CParts, much like middleware, work together to construct it and make it ready
for component developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far in this document, we covered how lifecycle methods are central to
CParts, and that CParts are central to Modulo components in general.
Now, we will learn how <code>renderObj</code> is central to lifecycle methods.
It's how lifecycle methods pass data and communicate, as a component passes
through the different phases.</p>


<h3>renderObj and lifecycle</h3>

<p>The renderObj goes through 3 phases. The first is during set-up, the second
during component factory initialization, and the third happens every time a
component rerenders.</p>

<ol>
    <li><code>loadObj</code> - This is the version created during the
    <code>load</code> phase, and is typically just the text and attributes of
    the component definition with any pre-processing done. Unlike the other
    objects, <code>loadObj</code> <em>can only</em> contain plain or
    JSON-friendly data types.</li>

    <li><code>baseRenderObj</code> - The <code>loadObj</code> is copied to the
    <code>baseRenderObj</code>, which is the result of the <code>factory</code>
    phase. This might have more dependencies injected, e.g. the template CPart
    at this point will have compiled the template code a JS function.</li>

    <li><code>renderObj</code> - This is the one that component developers are
    more likely to encounter. During first render, and every time a
    <code>.rerender()</code> method is called, <code>renderObj</code> is
    duplicated from the <code>baseRenderObj</code>, and then gets passed around
    through the <code>prepare</code>, <code>render</code>, <code>reconcile</code>,
    and <code>update</code> phases.</li>
</ol>




<p>Typically, unless developing new CParts, you will have little need to
directly interact with the <code>renderObj</code>. You already implicitly use
it in several cases. For example,
whenever you access variables in the <em>Script</em> CPart, the
<code>state</code> variable is in fact shorthand for
<code>element.renderObj.state</code>, or whenever you access <a
href="http://icheb.local:8080/docs/templating.html#variables">variables in the
template</a> <em>CPart</em> (e.g., <code>props.text</code> is
shorthand for <code>element.renderObj.props.text</code>).
So, if you are a component developer and not a CPart developer, and you find
yourself thinking that it doesn't make a lot of sense why you'd need to access
or modify the <code>renderObj</code> explicitly... You probably don't!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, use the following example to examine the output of the
following example to see what information is available or modified at each
step:</p>


<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<Template>
<label>
<input [state.bind] name="enabled" type="checkbox" />
Show messages in console</label>
</Template>

<State
    enabled:=false
></State>

<Script>
    function _logInfo(message, renderObj) {
        // Little helper function to do messages in console
        if (state.enabled) {
            const formattedOutput = JSON.stringify(renderObj, null, 2);
            console.log(message, formattedOutput);
        }
    }

    function prepareCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("prepareCallback:",  renderObj);
    }

    function renderCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("renderCallback:", renderObj);
    }

    function reconcileCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("reconcileCallback:", renderObj);
    }

    function updateCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo("updateCallback:", renderObj);
    }
