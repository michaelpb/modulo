<h1>Templating Reference</h1>


<p>Modulo's templating language comes with a standard library of filters and
template-tags, modeled closely on the behavior of Django's templating language
library. Although Django's has considerably more features, some Django
templates will work as Modulo templates without modification (just include it
with "src="!). In fact, there's such large overlap that much of this very
documentation was <a
href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/language/">copied and
arranged just like Django's own</a>, to be instantly more familiar to
developers. Thanks, Django!</p>



<mws-Section name="script">Built-in Template Tags</mws-Section>


<h3>comment</h3>

<p>Used specifically for commenting out blocks of Templating code. Ignores
everything between <code>{% comment %}</code> and <code>{% endcomment
%}</code>.  An optional note may be inserted in the first tag. This can be
useful to document why the code was commented out or disabled. You should avoid
nesting comment tags.</p>


<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    <p>Before comment</p>
    {% comment "Optional note" %}
        <p>Commented out text that will be ignored
          {{ nonExistingVar|brokenFilter:"abc" }}</p>
    {% endcomment %}
    <p>After comment</p>
</template>
'></mws-Demo>

<h3>for</h3>

<p>For-loops are for repeating the same HTML code multiple times. It will
repeat a block of templating code for every item in a specified array or
object. It's useful for displaying search results, blog articles, chat
messages, and much more: Any time you have unknown quantities or
<em>plural</em> amounts of data that you want to template on the screen.</p>

<p>At it's core, <code>{% for %}</code> will loop over each item in an array,
making the item available in a specified template variable. This is often done
to objects in an array stored in state, such as data that came back from an
API. Examine the following example:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    <ul>
        {% for athlete in state.athletes %}
            <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</template>

<state
  athletes:=&apos;[
    {"name": "Devante Adams"},
    {"name": "Steph Curry"},
    {"name": "Megan Rapinoe"}
  ]&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>

<p>Note that your for loops should conventionally follow the pattern of
<code>{% for SINGULAR_THING in PLURAL_THINGS %}</code>. For 3 examples of this:
<code>{% for item in state.item_data %}</code>,
<code>{% for user in users %}</code>, or
<code>{% for city in cities %}</code>.</p>

<p>Within the repeated code of the for
loop, then the "singular thing" (the variable defined by the for loop) will be
available as a template variable. Typically, the "plural variable" will be an
Array or Object defined from the <code>State</code> or <code>Props</code>
CParts.  Also, it's worth noting that you can loop over an array in reverse by
using the <code>|reversed</code> filter, e.g.
<code>{% for obj in list|reversed %}</code>.</p>

<p>If you need to loop over an <em>object</em>, you can unpack each key / value
pair into individual variables. For example, if your state contains an array of
(x, y) coordinates called <code>state.data</code>, you could use the following to output the list
of points:</p>


<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    <ul>
        {% for name, color in state.fave_colors %}
            <li><strong>{{ name }}</strong>: {{ color }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</template>

<state
    fave_colors:=&apos;{
      "Devante Adams": "Green",
      "Steph Curry": "Golden",
      "Megan Rapinoe": "Blue"
    }&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>


<h4>empty</h4>

<p>Often you will want to include a default, empty, or "404 message" if nothing
is in the array of a <code>for</code> tag. To avoid cluttering your loops with
extra if-statements, the for tag can take an optional <code>{% empty %}</code>
clause, which functions identically to an if-statement that executes only if
the given data is empty or could not be found (e.g. if 0 iterations of the loop
were run). Observe the following example:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    <ul>
        {% for name, color in state.fave_colors %}
            <li><strong>{{ name }}</strong>: {{ color }}</li>
        {% empty %}
            No athletes were found.
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</template>

<state
    fave_colors:=&apos;{}&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>


<h3>if</h3>

<p>The if-statement allows a block of HTML code to be conditionally
included. It allows "branching" in your templates: That is, one or more
optional "branches" or blocks of HTML templating code that will be included
only if a certain condition is satisfied.</p>


<p>The simplest behavior of the <code>{% if %}</code> tag is to evaluate a variable,
and if that variable both exists and is a "truthy" value according to JavaScript
(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy">see MDN "Truthy"</a>),
the specified block will be included.  By default, <code>if</code> will include
(or not) all code until it encounters an <code>{% endif %}</code> tag to close.
However, it also supports using an <code>{% else %}</code> tag before the
<code>{% endif %}</code> tag, which can provide alternative code.</p>

<p>Examine the following example, and observe what happens as you change state
variables from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>, or vice-versa:</p>


<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
ttitle="SimpleIf"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.show %}
        Hello testing template world!
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  show:=true
></state>
'
ttitle2="IfElse"
text2='
<template>
    {% if state.hello %}
        Hello testing template world!
    {% else %}
        Goodbye testing template world!
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  hello:=false
></state>
'></mws-Demo>

<h4>elif</h4>

<p>Like with the <code>else</code> tag, the <code>if</code> tag may also
optionally proceed <code>{% elif %}</code> tags, which is a shortened version
of the word "else" and "if", combined into a single, made-up word "elif". The
behavior of the <code>{% elif %}</code> is very similar to the "if": It requires
specifying condition which will be evaluated, and it will only include the
specified code block if that condition evaluates to be true.  Unlike the
<code>{% else %}</code> tag, a single <code>{% if %}</code> can has as many
<code>{% elif %}</code> tags as you'd like, and it is guaranteed that it will
only execute  one of those. In other words, only one <code>{% if %}</code>,
<code>{% elif %}</code>, or <code>{% else %}</code> code block will be
executed, and there's never a risk that two "elifs" could get executed in the
same "chain".</p>

<p>For an example of this, examine the following more complicated example:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.athletes %}
        Athletes exists. Total athletes: {{ state.athletes|length }}
    {% elif state.benched %}
        Benched exists. Total benched: {{ state.benched|length }}
    {% else %}
        No athletes.
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  benched:=&apos;[
    {"name": "Steph Curry"}
  ]&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>

<p>In the above, if <code>state.athletes</code> exists, the number of athletes will be
displayed by the <code>{{ state.athletes|length }}</code> filtered template variable.</p>

<h4>Operators</h4>

<p>Within the if tag, you can use a variety of "operators". Operators behave
similarly to JavaScript operators: They allow comparisons of template variables
with other template variables and/or hardcoded values. There are about a dozen
built-in operators. As with template-tags, it is also possible to configure
your own custom operators.</p>

<p>Built-in operators: <code>==, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, !=, not in, is not, is, in, not, gt, lt</code>



<h4><code>==</code>, <code>is</code> (operator)</h4>

<p>Check for equality. Note that this will be a "strict" comparison, equivalent
to JavaScript's triple-equals <code>===</code> operator.  The syntax variants
<code>==</code> and <code>is</code> are aliases of each other.</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.somevar == "x" %}
        This appears if variable somevar equals the string "x"
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  somevar="x"
></state>
'></mws-Demo>



<h4><code>!=</code>, <code>is not</code> (operator)</h4>

<p>Check for inequality. Note that this will be a "strict" comparison, equivalent to
JavaScript's triple-not-equals <code>!==</code> operator. The syntax variants
<code>!==</code> and <code>is not</code> are aliases of each other.</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.somevar != "x" %}
        This appears if variable state.somevar does not equal the string "x".
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  somevar="y"
></state>
'></mws-Demo>


<h4><code>not</code> (operator)</h4>

<p>You can use "not" to invert or negate an "if" tag:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if not state.show %}
        Do not show it!
    {% else %}
        Show it!
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  show:=false
></state>
'></mws-Demo>


<h4><code>lt</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> (operators)</h4>

<p>Less than. Has a few variants: <code>lt</code> and <code>&lt;</code> will
check to see if a variable is strictly less than a given variable or value,
while <code>&lt;=</code> will be "less than or equal to" and thus also allow it
if its equal.  Example:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.somevar lt 100 %}
        This appears if variable somevar is less than 100.
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  somevar:=50
></state>
'></mws-Demo>



<h4><code>gt</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> (operators)</h4>

<p>Greater than. Has a few variants: <code>gt</code> and <code>&gt;</code> will
check to see if a variable is strictly greater than a given variable or value,
while <code>&gt;=</code> will be "greater than or equal to" and thus also allow
it if its equal.  Example:</p>


<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.somevar gt 100 %}
        This appears if variable somevar is greater than 100.
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  somevar:=2600
></state>
'></mws-Demo>


<h4><code>in</code>, <code>not in</code> (operators)</h4>

<p>Contained within. Unlike the built-in JavaScript operator "in" which is only
supported by Objects, this operator supports Strings, Arrays, and Objects as
the "container" types being checked. In all cases, it will test whether the
given value is within the given container.  The <code>not in</code> operator
does what you might expect: The exact opposite of the <code>in</code> operator.
The following are some examples of how the <code>in</code> operator will be
interpreted in different contexts:</p>



<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
ttitle="String"
text='
<template>
    {% if "B.C.E." in state.era %}
        This appears since "B.C.E." is a substring of "{{ state.era }}"
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  era="3rd Century B.C.E. (Macedonia)"
></state>
'

ttitle2="Array"
text2='
<template>
    {% if state.word in state.greetings %}
        "{{ state.word }}" was found in: {{ state.greetings|join:", " }}
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  word="hello"
  greetings:=&apos;[
    "hallo",
    "hello",
    "hola",
    "óla"
  ]&apos;
></state>'

ttitle3="Object"
text3='
<template>
    {% if "author" in state.article %}
        Author was specified: {{ state.article.author }}
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
  article:=&apos;{
    "author": "Albert Einstein",
    "year": 1949,
    "month": "May",
    "publication": "Monthly Review",
    "title": "Why Socialism?"
  }&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>

<p>Note that in these examples, some use hardcoded strings in places (e.g.
<code>"B.C.E"</code>), while others use variables in the same place (e.g.
<code>state.word</code>). As with every if-statement operator, you can either
hardcoded values and variables are interchangeable.</p>

<h4>Filters</h4>

<p>You can also use filters in combination with operators within an if tag. For
example:</p>

<mws-Demo demotype="minipreview"
text='
<template>
    {% if state.athletes|length gt 2 %}
        <p>There are more than 2 athletes!</p>
    {% endif %}
</template>

<state
    athletes:=&apos;[
        {"name": "Devante Adams"},
        {"name": "Steph Curry"},
        {"name": "Megan Rapinoe"}
    ]&apos;
></state>
'></mws-Demo>
