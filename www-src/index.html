        <p><strong>Zero set-up</strong> - Like the golden age of jQuery, just
        drop it into any HTML file.  Unlike jQuery, that 1 file packs in many
        of the creature-comforts of a modern component framework, without any
        dependencies or new syntax to learn.</p>
        <!--
        a modern component system, a swappable templating language based
        on Liquid-syntax, DOM resolution, and more.
        , a tiny
        build system to pack your CSS and JS for production, and even debug
        tools.</p>-->

        <p><strong>A gentle learning curve</strong> - Modulo's declarative,
        synchronous coding style is intended to be easier for newbie coders to
        pick-up&mdash;in fact, many components can be developed without use of
        any JavaScript!</p>

        <p><strong><strike style="color: gray">Progressive Web Apps</strike>
        Progressive Enhancement</strong> - Modulo makes few assumptions, and
        renders components mixed with plain HTML for easier integration into
        backend apps. JAMStack and PWA's are fine and all, but what about all
        our existing server-side apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, Go, or that one
        home-grown PHP monster that will never go away? Sprinkle in some Modulo
        components to make your "traditional" web apps
        <em>shine</em>.</p>
        <!--
        <abbr title="In fact, Modulo templating language uses a backend-inspired 'Djangolike' or Liquid-style syntax templating language, e.g. {{ example|filter }}">

        <p><strong>CParts</strong> - CParts are like Lego blocks for your
        components! Create components by snapping together one or more
        Component Parts or <em>CParts</em>. Mix Script, Style, State, Props,
        and Templates to make components that have one or all, or even
        multiples, of these features. Reusing CParts between components
        provides a powerful system of "composition-based" inheritance.</p>

        <p><strong>Everything is swappable</strong> - Components configure
        themselves, meaning you can create custom CParts, "mix and match" your
        favorite JS templating languages, or fine-tune DOM-resolution behavior
        on a per-component basis.</p>

        <p><strong>Lifecycle hooks and directives</strong> - Hook your own code
        into the rendering process, either through lifecycle callbacks, or by
        defining custom attribute-based directives.</p>

        <p><strong>"It's like React"</strong> - Modulo is "batteries-included"
        to function like React.js or Vue.js. You get encapsulated components
        with state management, two-way data binding, props &amp; types,
        computed values, DOM resolution, event directives, and more. You even
        get a simple importing and namespacing system, that self-packs with
        your components into a single JS file!</p>

        <p><strong>Clean & concise</strong> - The code-base of Modulo itself is
        intentionally kept short &amp; sweet: It hovers around roughly 1000
        <abbr title="Source Lines of Code - This counts 'physical lines' and thus does not include comments, documentation, blanks, etc">SLOC</abbr>,
        80 char line limit, 4 spaces of
        indent, and a <abbr title="Almost all functions have a cyclomatic complexity of 3 or lower">low-complexity</abbr>
        imperative style. When something goes wrong (which it probably will
        since it's a new framework), it's easy to "<tt>git blame</tt>"
        Modulo.</p>

        <p><strong>A basis for whatever comes next</strong> - Want to write
        your own component framework? Modulo's core is in only a few hundred
        lines of code. Read the source code, fork away, and swap the
        "batteries-included" for your own!</p>
